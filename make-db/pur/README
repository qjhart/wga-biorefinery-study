Californiaâ€™s pesticide use reporting program is recognized as the most
comprehensive in the world. In 1990, California became the first state
to require full reporting of agricultural pesticide use in response to
demands for more realistic and comprehensive pesticide use data. Under
the program, all agricultural pesticide use must be reported monthly
to county agricultural commissioners, who in turn, report the data to
DPR.

California has a broad legal definition of "agricultural use" so the
reporting requirements include pesticide applications to parks, golf
courses, cemeteries, rangeland, pastures, and along roadside and
railroad rights-of-way. In addition, all postharvest pesticide
treatments of agricultural commodities must be reported along with all
pesticide treatments in poultry and fish production as well as some
livestock applications. The primary exceptions to the reporting
requirements are home-and-garden use and most industrial and
institutional uses.
