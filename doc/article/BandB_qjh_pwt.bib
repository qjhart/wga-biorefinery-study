  abstract =	 {In the Iberian Peninsula Mediterranean oak forests
                  have been transformed into a mosaic landscape of
                  four main patch-types: forests, savannas, shrublands
                  and grasslands. We used aerial photographs over a
                  period of 45 years (1958-2002) to quantify the
                  persistence and rates of transitions between
                  vegetation patch-types in southern Portugal, where
                  cork oak is the dominant tree species. We used
                  logistic regression to relate vegetation changes
                  with topographical features and wildfire
                  history. Over the 45 years, shrublands have been the
                  most persistent patch-type (59\%), and have been
                  expanding; forests are also persistent (55\%) but
                  have been decreasing since 1985; savannas and
                  grasslands were less persistent (33\% and 15\%,
                  respectively). Shrublands persistence was
                  significantly correlated with wildfire occurrence,
                  particularly on southern exposures after 1995. In
                  contrast, forest persistence decreased with wildfire
                  occurrence, and forests were more likely to change
                  into shrublands where wildfire had occurred after
                  1995.},

                  created severe fire problems across the West. Not
                  every forest is at risk of uncharacteristically
                  severe wildfire, but drier forests are in need of
                  active management to mitigate fire hazard. We
                  summarize a set of simple principles important to
                  address in fuel reduction treatments: reduction of
                  surface fuels, increasing the height to live crown,
                  decreasing crown density, and retaining large trees
                  of fire-resistant species. Thinning and prescribed
                  fire can be useful tools to achieve these
                  objectives.  Low thinning will be more effective
                  than crown or selection thinning, and management of
                  surface fuels will increase the likelihood that the
                  stand will survive a wildfire. Five empirical
                  examples of such treatment are discussed: Hayfork
                  fires, California, 1987; Tyee fire, Washington,
                  1994; Megram fire, California, 1999; Hayman fire,
                  Colorado, 2002; and the Cone fire, California,
                  2002. Applying treatments at an appropriate
                  landscape scale will be critical to the success of
                  fuel reduction treatments in reducing wildfire
                  losses in Western forests.},

                  information to support the application of forest
                  fire behavior models. In particular, reliable
                  estimates of several critical forest canopy
                  structure metrics, including canopy bulk density,
                  canopy height, canopy fuel weight, and canopy base
                  height, are required to accurately map the spatial
                  distribution of canopy fuels and model fire behavior
                  over the landscape. The use of airborne laser
                  scanning (LIDAR), a high-resolution active remote
                  sensing technology, provides for accurate and
                  efficient measurement of three-dimensional forest
                  structure over extensive areas. In this study,
                  regression analysis was used to develop predictive
                  models relating a variety of LIDAR-based metrics to
                  the canopy fuel parameters estimated from inventory
                  data collected at plots established within stands of
                  varying condition within Capitol State Forest, in
                  western Washington State. Strong relationships
                  between LIDAR-derived metrics and field-based fuel
                  estimates were found for all parameters [sqrt(crown
                  fuel weight): R2=0.86; ln(crown bulk density):
                  R2=0.84; canopy base height: R2=0.77; canopy height:
                  R2=0.98]. A cross-validation procedure was used to
                  assess the reliability of these models. LIDAR-based
                  fuel prediction models can be used to develop maps
                  of critical canopy fuel parameters over forest areas
                  in the Pacific Northwest.},

                  substitution based on simple mathematical models of
                  carbon stocks and flows assuming the growth
                  conditions of trees in the southern US. Significant
                  carbon benefit can be obtained by substituting
                  biomass derived from short-rotation woody crops
                  (SRWC) for coal or gasoline as opposed to
                  sequestering carbon in standing trees. When biomass
                  substitutes fossil fuel, the use of a given piece of
                  land is not limited to just the period until the
                  forest matures, as in the case of afforestation. At
                  present high costs of existing biomass-based
                  technologies and unavailability of cost-effective
                  technologies (e.g., biomass-integrated
                  gasifier/steam-injected gas turbine (BIG/STIG))
                  limits carbon sequestration to
                  afforestation/reforestation for which the costs have
                  been found to be modest. If growth rates of trees in
                  afforested/reforested lands could be increased to
                  the levels that are comparable to SRWC, more carbon
                  benefit could be realized for a short-term horizon
                  from afforestation than using biomass to displace
                  fossil fuels. Carbon sequestered through
                  afforestation projects can be used to earn carbon
                  credits to meet carbon reduction targets through
                  Kyoto mechanisms. As biomass-based technologies such
                  as BIG/STIG or conversion of biomass to ethanol
                  become commercially viable in the future, growing
                  SRWC for substituting fossil fuels may become a
                  cost-effective strategy to combat climate change.},

                  and the challenges for managing forest carbon
                  resources in the 21st century. Forests in the United
                  States were in approximate carbon balance with the
                  atmosphere from 1600-1800.  Utilization and land
                  clearing caused a large pulse of forest carbon
                  emissions during the 19th century, followed by
                  regrowth and net forest carbon sequestration in the
                  20th century. Recent data and knowledge of the
                  general behavior of forests after disturbance
                  suggest that the rate of forest carbon sequestration
                  is declining. A goal of an additional 100 to 200 Tg

  abstract =	 {Abstract: There is broad consensus that active
                  management through thinning and fire is urgently
                  needed in many forests of the western United
                  States. This consensus stems from physically based
                  models of fire behavior and substantial empirical
                  evidence. But the types of thinning and fire and
                  where they are applied are the subjects of much
                  debate. We propose that low thinning is the most
                  appropriate type of thinning practice. Treating
                  surface fuels, reducing ladder fuels, and opening
                  overstory canopies generally produce fire-safe
                  forest conditions, but large, fire-resistant trees
                  are also important components of fire-safe
                  forests. The context of place is critical in
                  assigning priority for the limited resources that
                  will be available for restoration
                  treatments. Historical low-severity fire regimes,
                  because of their current high hazards and dominance
                  by fire-resistant species, are the highest priority
                  for treatment. Mixed-severity fire regimes are of
                  intermediate priority, and high-severity fire
                  regimes are of lowest priority. Classification
                  systems based on potential vegetation will help
                  identify these fire regimes at a local scale.
                  Restauracion de Bosques y Fuego-Principios en el
                  Contexto del Sitio Resumen: Existe un amplio
                  consenso de que en muchos bosques del oeste de
                  EE.UU. se requiere con urgencia un manejo activo
                  mediante tala y fuego. Este consenso se basa en
                  modelos fisicos de comportamiento de fuego, asi como
                  en importante evidencia empirica que aumenta cada
                  ano. Pero los tipos de tala y fuego y el lugar en
                  que se aplican, son temas de mucho
                  debate. Proponemos que la tala reducida es la mas
                  apropiada. El tratamiento de combustibles de
                  superficie, la reduccion de combustibles escalera y
                  la apertura de doseles generalmente producen
                  condiciones a salvo de fuego en los bosques, pero
                  arboles grandes resistentes al fuego tambien son
                  componentes importantes de bosques a salvo de
                  fuego. El contexto del lugar es critico en la
                  asignacion de prioridades a los limitados recursos
                  disponibles para tratamientos de restauracion. Los
                  regimenes de fuego de baja intensidad, debido a sus
                  altos riesgos actuales y la dominancia de especies
                  resistentes al fuego, son la mayor prioridad para el
                  tratamiento. Los regimenes de fuego de severidad
                  mixta son de prioridad intermedia y los regimenes de
                  fuego de alta severidad son de menor prioridad. Los
                  sistemas de clasificacion basados en la vegetacion
                  potencial ayudaran a identificar estos regimenes de
                  fuego a escala local.}

  abstract =	 {This study investigates the global impact of wood as
                  a building material by considering emissions of
                  carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Wood is compared
                  with other materials in terms of stored carbon and
                  emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel energy
                  used in manufacturing.  An analysis of typical forms
                  of building construction shows that wood buildings
                  require much lower process energy and result in
                  lower carbon emissions than buildings of other
                  materials such as brick, aluminium, steel and
                  concrete. If a shift is made towards greater use of
                  wood in buildings, the low fossil fuel requirement
                  for manufacturing wood compared with other materials
                  is much more significant in the long term than the
                  carbon stored in the wood building products. As a
                  corollary, a shift from wood to non-wood materials
                  would result in an increase in energy requirements
                  and carbon emissions. The results presented in this
                  paper show that a 17% increase in wood usage in the
                  New Zealand building industry could result in a 20%
                  reduction in carbon emissions from the manufacture
                  of all building materials, being a reduction of
                  about 1.5% of New Zealand's total emissions.  The
                  reduction in emissions is mainly a result of using
                  wood in place of brick and aluminium, and to a
                  lesser extent steel and concrete, all of which
                  require much more process energy than wood. There
                  would be a corresponding decrease of about 1.5% in
                  total national fossil fuel consumption. These
                  figures have implications for the global forestry
                  and building industries. Any increases in wood use
                  must be accompanied by corresponding increases in
                  areas of forest being managed for long term
                  sustained yield production.},

                  carbon (BC) from boreal crown fires in Canada is
                  essential for assessing the effect on regional
                  climate from natural wildfire aerosol emissions
                  versus that from anthropogenic activities. This is
                  particularly relevant because climate change will
                  likely lead to increased wildfire activity in
                  northern Canada. During 4-5 July 1998, two
                  controlled fires in Northwest Territories, Canada,
                  were conducted as part of the International Crown
                  Fire Modeling Experiment. We report here the BC and
                  organic carbon (OC) compositions of aerosols
                  produced during the flaming and smoldering stages of
                  burning. Particles were collected on back-to-back
                  quartz-fiber filters by helicopter with a hi-vol
                  sampler and at ground level with a dichotomous

                  fractions. An analysis of the back filter in
                  relation to the front filter from the dichot sampler
                  for both the fine and coarse fractions provided a

                  ANNUAL GRASSES: IMPLICATIONS FOR AN HISTORICAL
                  INVASION},
  journal =	 {Ecology},

  abstract =	 {Though established populations of invasive species
                  can exert substantial competitive effects on native
                  populations, exotic propagules may require
                  disturbances that decrease competitive interference
                  by resident species in order to become
                  established. We compared the relative
                  competitiveness of native perennial and exotic
                  annual grasses in a California coastal prairie
                  grassland to test whether the introduction of exotic
                  propagules to coastal grasslands in the 19th century
                  was likely to have been sufficient to shift
                  community composition from native perennial to
                  exotic annual grasses. Under experimental field
                  conditions, we compared the aboveground productivity
                  of native species alone to native species competing
                  with exotics, and exotic species alone to exotic
                  species competing with natives. Over the course of
                  the four-year experiment, native grasses became
                  increasingly dominant in the mixed-assemblage plots
                  containing natives and exotics. Although the
                  competitive interactions in the first growing season
                  favored the exotics, over time the native grasses
                  significantly reduced the productivity of exotic
                  grasses. The number of exotic seedlings emerging and
                  the biomass of dicot seedlings removed during
                  weeding were also significantly lower in plots
                  containing natives as compared to plots that did not
                  contain natives. We found evidence that the ability
                  of established native perennial species to limit
                  space available for exotic annual seeds to germinate
                  and to limit the light available to exotic seedlings
                  reduced exotic productivity and shifted competitive
                  interactions in favor of the natives. If
                  interactions between native perennial and exotic
                  annual grasses follow a similar pattern in other
                  coastal grassland habitats, then the introduction of
                  exotic grass propagules alone without changes in
                  land use or climate, or both, was likely
                  insufficient to convert the region&#39;s
                  grasslands.}

                  archived samples collected by the soil survey staff
                  in the 1940s and 1950s, we resampled 125 locations
                  in California from the Imperial Valley in the south
                  to Tehama county in the north and analyzed samples
                  for properties important to plant production. We
                  collected three samples from the 0- to 25-cm depth
                  at each location and air-dried them for
                  analysis. For each 1945 and 2001 sample pH,
                  electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, total
                  carbon, plant available phosphorus, texture and
                  color was measured. We compared the data across the
                  entire state as well as by current land-use, and
                  geographic region. Across the state, plant-available
                  phosphorus, total carbon, pH, and percent clay
                  increased significantly (95\% confidence level) as
                  did percent silt and total nitrogen (90\%
                  confidence).  In contrast, electrical conductivity,
                  and percent sand decreased significantly (95\%
                  confidence). Chroma also decreased significantly
                  statewide (90\% confidence level). The degree of
                  change varied according to land-use and geographic
                  region. Based on this sample, California's soil
                  quality has not significantly decreased over the
                  past 60 years.  These results also suggest that
                  defining and evaluating soil quality is difficult
                  due to conflicting trends and interpretations of
                  soil quality indices.},

                  Biofuels are a potential low-carbon energy source,

                  cropbased biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and
                  the United States creates a "biofuel carbon debt" by
                  releasing 17 to 420 times more CO2 than the annual
                  greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels
                  would provide by displacing fossil fuels. In

                  biomass grown on degraded and abandoned agricultural

                  simulation model, FARSITE, and its performance under
                  simplified test conditions. FARSITE incorporates
                  existing models of surface fire, crown fire,
                  point-source fire acceleration, spotting, and fuel
                  moisture. This documentation of how the simulation
                  was constructed, and how the individual fire
                  behavior models perform, will be useful to
                  researchers and managers who use FARSITE or are
                  interested in fire growth simulation. The models
                  were integrated using a vector propagation technique
                  for fire perimeter expansion that controls for both
                  space and time resolution of fire growth over the
                  landscape. The model produces vector fire perimeters
                  (polygons) at specified time intervals. The vertices
                  of these polygons contain information on the fire's
                  spread rate and intensity, which are interpolated to
                  produce raster maps of fire behavior. Because fire
                  behavior at each vertex is assumed independent of
                  the others, the simulation outputs illustrate the
                  strict spatial consequences to fire behavior of
                  incorporating the models into a two-dimensional
                  simulation. Simplified test conditions show that
                  surface fire growth and intensity conform to
                  idealized patterns.  Similarities also exist between
                  simulated crown fires and observed patterns of
                  extreme wind-driven fires. Complex patterns of fi re
                  growth and behavior result from the spatial and
                  temporal dependencies in the model. The limitations
                  and assumptions of this approach are discussed.}

                  in the Northern Hemisphere provide a significant
                  sink for atmospheric $CO_2$; however, estimates of
                  the magnitude and distribution of this sink vary
                  greatly.  National forest inventories provide
                  strong, measurement-based constraints on the
                  magnitude of net forest carbon uptake. We brought
                  together forest sector C budgets for Canada, the
                  United States, Europe, Russia, and China that were
                  derived from forest inventory information,
                  allometric relationships, and supplementary data
                  sets and models. Together, these suggest that
                  northern forests and woodlands provided a total sink
                  for 0.6-0.7 Pg of C per year $(1 Pg = 10^{15} g)$
                  during the early 1990s, consisting of 0.21 Pg C/yr
                  in living biomass, 0.08 Pg C/yr in forest products,
                  0.15 Pg C/yr in dead wood, and 0.13 Pg C/yr in the
                  forest floor and soil organic matter. Estimates of
                  changes in soil C pools have improved but remain the
                  least certain terms of the budgets. Over 80\% of the
                  estimated sink occurred in one-third of the forest
                  area, in temperate regions affected by fire
                  suppression, agricultural abandonment, and
                  plantation forestry. Growth in boreal regions was
                  offset by fire and other disturbances that vary
                  considerably from year to year. Comparison with
                  atmospheric inversions suggests significant land C
                  sinks may occur outside the forest sector.},

                  considered for treating millions of forested acres
                  that are overstocked and prone to wildfire. The
                  objectives of these treatments include tree growth
                  redistribution, tree species regulation, timber
                  harvest, wildlife habitat improvement, and
                  wildfire-hazard reduction. Depending on the forest
                  type and its structure, thinning has both positive
                  and negative impacts on crown fire potential. Crown
                  bulk density, surface fuel, and crown base height
                  are primary stand characteristics that determine
                  crown fire potential. Thinning from below, free
                  thinning, and reserve tree shelterwoods have the
                  greatest opportunity for reducing the risk of crown
                  fire behavior. Selection thinning and crown thinning
                  that maintain multiple crown layers, along with
                  individual tree selection systems, will not reduce
                  the risk of crown fires except in the driest
                  ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.)
                  forests. Moreover, unless the surface fuels created
                  by using these treatments are themselves treated,
                  intense surface wildfire may result, likely negating
                  positive effects of reducing crown fire
                  potential. No single thinning approach can be
                  applied to reduce the risk of wildfires in the
                  multiple forest types of the West. The best general
                  approach for managing wildfire damage seems to be
                  managing tree density and species composition with
                  well-designed silvicultural systems at a landscape
                  scale that includes a mix of thinning, surface fuel
                  treatments, and prescribed fire with proactive
                  treatment in areas with high risk to wildfire.}

                  costs and supplies in eleven US
                  states. Transportation costs increased with
                  increased facility demand and were lowest in Iowa,
                  North Dakota and South Dakota and highest in South
                  Carolina, Missouri, Georgia, and Alabama. Farmgate

                  and South Dakota and highest in Iowa and
                  Nebraska. Across the eleven states, delivered
                  feedstock costs ranged from \$33 to \$55/dry tonne
                  to supply a facility requiring 100,000
                  tonne/yr. Delivered feedstock costs for a 630,000
                  tonne/yr facility ranged from \$36 to \$58/dry

                  balances of building materials over their
                  lifecycle. Previous studies have shown that the use
                  of wood for construction generally results in lower
                  energy use and CO2 emission than does the use of
                  concrete. To determine the uncertainties of this
                  generality, we studied the changes in energy and CO2
                  balances caused by variation of key parameters in
                  the manufacture and use of the materials comprising
                  a wood- and a concrete-framed building. Parameters
                  considered were clinker production efficiency,
                  blending of cement, crushing of aggregate, recycling
                  of steel, lumber drying efficiency, material
                  transportation distance, carbon intensity of fossil
                  fuel, recovery of logging, sawmill, construction and
                  demolition residues for biofuel, and growth and
                  exploitation of surplus forest not needed for wood
                  material production. We found the materials of the
                  wood-framed building had lower energy and CO2
                  balances than those of the concrete-framed building
                  in all cases but one. Recovery of demolition and
                  wood processing residues for use in place of fossil
                  fuels contributed most significantly to the lower
                  energy and CO2 balances of wood-framed building
                  materials. We conclude that the use of wood building
                  material instead of concrete, coupled with greater
                  integration of wood by-products into energy systems,
                  would be an effective means of reducing fossil fuel
                  use and net CO2 emission to the atmosphere.},

                  between native and non-native plants after
                  large-scale biological invasions. Using the example
                  of native perennial bunchgrasses and non-native
                  annual grasses in California grasslands, we sought
                  to determine the effects of interference from
                  non-native grasses on the different life stages of
                  the native perennial bunchgrass Nassella
                  pulchra. Further, we asked whether N. pulchra
                  interferes with non-native annual grasses, and
                  whether competition for water is an important
                  component of these interspecific interactions in
                  this water-limited system. In a series of field and
                  greenhouse experiments employing neighbor removals
                  and additions of water, we found that seedling
                  recruitment of N. pulchra was strongly
                  seed-limited. In both field and greenhouse, natural
                  recruitment of N. pulchra seedlings from grassland
                  soil was extremely low. In field plots where we
                  added seeds, addition of water to field plots
                  increased density of N. pulchra seedlings by 88\%
                  and increased total aboveground N. pulchra seedling
                  biomass by almost 90\%, suggesting that water was
                  the primary limiting resource. In the greenhouse,
                  simulated drought early in the growing season had a
                  greater negative effect on the biomass of annual
                  seedlings than on the seedlings of N. pulchra. In
                  the field, presence of annuals reduced growth and
                  seed production of all sizes of N. pulchra, and
                  these effects did not decrease as N. pulchra
                  individuals increased in size. These negative
                  effects appeared to be due to competition for water,
                  because N. pulchra plants showed less negative
                  pre-dawn leaf water potentials when annual neighbors
                  were removed. Also, simply adding water caused the
                  same increases in aboveground biomass and seed
                  production of N. pulchra plants as removing all
                  annual neighbors. We found no evidence that
                  established N. pulchra plants were able to suppress
                  non-native annual grasses. Removing large N. pulchra
                  individuals did not affect peak biomass per unit
                  area of annuals. We conclude that effects of
                  interference from non native annuals are important
                  through all life stages of the native perennial
                  N. pulchra. Our results suggest that persistence of
                  native bunchgrasses may be enhanced by greater
                  mortality of annual than perennial seedlings during
                  drought, and possibly by reduced competition for
                  water in wet years because of increased resource
                  availability.}

  abstract =	 {The risks, hazards, and relative severity of
                  wildland fires are presented here within the
                  ecological context of historical natural fire
                  regimes, time, space, and process. As the public
                  dialogue on the role and impacts of wildland fire
                  increases, it is imperative for all partners to
                  converge on clear and concise terminology that
                  defines risk, hazard, and the characteristic (or
                  uncharacteristic) nature of wildland fire.  These
                  terms must be defined in the context of scale--both
                  spatial and temporal. The concept of historical
                  natural fire regimes involves a classification of
                  the characteristic, or "natural" processes and
                  effects associated with wildland fire occurring in
                  sustainable ecosystems.  When a wildland fire occurs
                  within the time, space, and severity parameters of
                  the historical natural fire regime, the fire can be
                  called natural, or "characteristic". The milieu of
                  disturbance effects we call catastrophic, such as
                  economic losses, damages to communities and
                  structures, or impacts on short-term aesthetic
                  values involve social, cultural, and economic values
                  and risks--none is directly associated with
                  ecological values, damages, or risks. In the context
                  of technical risk assessments, the term "risk"
                  considers not only the probability of an event, but
                  also includes values and expected losses. However,
                  within the fire community it refers only to the
                  probability of ignition (both man- and
                  lightning-caused). [`]Hazard' refers to the state of
                  the fuel, exclusive of weather or the environs in
                  which the fuel is found. Unlike many common uses of
                  the term [`]severity', fire severity refers
                  specifically to the effect a fire has on wildland
                  systems. It is inappropriate to use the term
                  severity to describe the behavior of the fire
                  phenomenon itself. Instead, we should confine its
                  use to that relating only to a fire's
                  effect. Finally, I discuss the limitations and
                  conflicts to integrating all social, cultural,
                  economic, health, and safety values in our public
                  and policy-forming dialogue relating to fire risk,
                  hazard, and severity. Typical risk assessments
                  consider all relevant endpoints, including
                  socio-economic, management, as well as ecological
                  elements. Herein, I use the Black Mountain 2 Fire
                  from August 2003 in the northern Rockies to
                  illustrate the spatiotemporal extent of fire's
                  impacts on the endpoints. When expressed over all
                  affected spatiotemporal scales, the overlay of all
                  endpoints from this synthetic scenario results in a
                  "decision space" ranging in time from an hour to a
                  century, and in space ranging from a few square
                  meters to the continent.},

  abstract =	 {As the human population grows and natural resources
                  decline, there is pressure to apply increasing
                  levels of top-down, command-and-control management
                  to natural resources. This is manifested in attempts
                  to control ecosystems and in socioeconomic
                  institutions that respond to erratic or surprising
                  ecosystem behavior with more control. Command and
                  control, however, usually results in unforeseen
                  consequences for both natural ecosystems and human
                  welfare in the form of collapsing resources, social
                  and economic strife, and losses of biological
                  diversity.  We describe the "pathology of natural
                  resource management," defined as a loss of system
                  resilience when the range of natural variation in
                  the system is reduced encapsulates the unsustainable
                  environmental, social, and economic outcomes of
                  command-and-control resource management.  If natural
                  levels of variation in system behavior are reduced
                  through command-and-control, then the system becomes
                  less resilient to external perturbations, resulting
                  in crises and surprises. We provide several examples
                  of this pathology in management. An ultimate
                  pathology emerges when resource management agencies,
                  through initial success with command and control,
                  lose sight of their original purposes, eliminate
                  research and monitoring, and focus on efficiency of
                  control. They then become isolated from the managed
                  systems and inflexible in structure. Simultaneously,
                  through overcapitalization, society becomes
                  dependent upon command and control, demands it in
                  greater intensity, and ignores the underlying
                  ecological change or collapse that is
                  developing. Solutions to this pathology cannot come
                  from further command and control (regulations) but
                  must come from innovative approaches involving
                  incentives leading to more resilient ecosystems,
                  more flexible agencies, more self-reliant
                  industries, and a more knowledgeable citizenry. We
                  discuss several aspects of ecosystem pattern and
                  dynamics at large scales that provide insight into
                  ecosystem resilience, and we propose a "Golden Rule"
                  of natural resource management that we believe is
                  necessary for sustainability: management should
                  strive to retain critical types and ranges of
                  natural variation in resource systems in order to
                  maintain their resiliency.  Comando-y-control y la
                  patologia del manejo de los recursos naturales A
                  medida que la poblacion humana crece y los recursos
                  naturales declinan, existen presiones para aplicar
                  niveles crecientes de manejo de recursos naturales
                  verticalistas y de comando-y-control. Esto se
                  manifesta en los intentos de controlar los
                  ecosistemas y en instituciones socioeconomicas que
                  responden a los comportamientos erraticos o
                  sorpresivos de los ecosistemas con mas control. Sin
                  embargo, el comando-y-control tiene usualmente
                  resultados imprevistos tanto para los ecosistemas
                  naturales como para el bienestar humano, tales
                  resultados toman la forma de recursos que colapsan,
                  conflictos sociales y economicos y perdidas de la
                  diversidad biologica. En el presente trabajo,
                  describimos la "patologia del manejo de los recursos
                  naturales" (definida como una perdida de la
                  elasticidad del sistema cuando la magnitud de la
                  variacion natural en el sistema es reducida), que
                  condensa los resultados
                  ambientales-sociales-economicos insostenibles
                  producidos por el manejo de recursos con una optica
                  de comando-y-control. Si los niveles de variacion
                  natural en el comportamiento de un sistema son
                  reducidos a traves de comando-y-control, entonces el
                  sistema se hace menos elastico a las perturbaciones
                  externas, lo cual resulta en crisis y
                  sorpresas. Nosotros proveemos de varios ejemplos de
                  esta patologia en el manejo. Una patologia extrema
                  surge cuando las agencias de manejo de recursos,
                  pierden de vista sus propositos originales debido al
                  exito del uso de comando-y-control, eliminando la
                  investigacion y el monitoreo y concentrandose en la
                  eficiencia y el control. De esta forma, estas
                  agencias se aislan de los sistemas bajo manejo y se
                  hacen mas inflexibles en su
                  estructura. Simultaneamente y por medio de la
                  sobrecapitalizacion, la sociedad se hace mas depe
                  diente del comando-y-control, demanda con mayores
                  intensidades e ignora los cambios ecologicos
                  subyacentes o el colapso que se esta

  journal =	 {Ecological Applications in press},
  note =	 {- All fuels treatments create carbon emissions, but
                  emissions can be reduced and future carbon stocks
                  increased by modifying treatments to reduce surface
                  fuels, small trees, and intermediate size,
                  fire-sensitive species. - Some research has
                  suggested that fire suppression has increased
                  live-tree carbon stocks as a result of increased
                  stem density and expansion by wood biomass into
                  areas that were historically open as a result of
                  frequent fire (Houghton et al. 2000, Hurtt et al.
                  2002). However, a recent study by Fellows and
                  Goulden (2008) found lower carbon stocks in modern
                  fire-suppressed conditions than in 1930, due to the
                  loss of large trees},
  abstract =	 {Depending on management, forests can be an important
                  sink or source of carbon that if released as CO2
                  could contribute to global warming.  Many western
                  forests are being treated to reduce fuels, yet the
                  effects of these treatments on forest carbon are not
                  well understood. We compared the immediate effects
                  of fuels treatments on carbon stocks and releases in
                  replicated plots before and after treatment, and
                  against a reconstruction of active-fire stand
                  conditions for the same forest in 1865. Total live
                  tree carbon was substantially lower in modern
                  fire-suppressed conditions (and all of the
                  treatments) than the same forest under an
                  active-fire regime. Although fire suppression has
                  increased stem density, current forests have fewer
                  large trees, reducing total live tree carbon stocks
                  and shifting a higher proportion of those stocks
                  into small-diameter, firesensitive trees. Prescribed
                  burning released 14.8 Mg C ha-1, with pre-burn
                  thinning increasing the average release by 70\% and
                  contributing 21.9-37.5 Mg C ha-1 in milling
                  waste. Fire suppression may have incurred a double
                  carbon penalty by reducing stocks and contributing
                  to emissions with fuels treatment activities or
                  inevitable wildfire combustion. All treatments
                  reduced fuels and increased fire resistance but most
                  of the gains were achieved with understory thinning
                  with only modest increases in the much heavier
                  overstory thinning. We suggest modifying current
                  treatments to focus on reducing surface fuels,
                  actively thinning the majority of small trees, and
                  removing only fire-sensitive species in the
                  merchantable, intermediate size class. These changes
                  would retain most of current carbon pool levels,
                  reduce prescribed burn and potential future wildfire
                  emissions, and favor stand development of large,
                  fire-resistant trees which can better stabilize
                  carbon stocks.}

                  a trade-off between exploiting economies of scale in

                  wildfires, and these fires and subsequent recovery
                  can change the amount of carbon released to the
                  atmosphere because conifer forests contain large
                  carbon stores.  Stand-replacing fires switch
                  ecosystems to being a net source of carbon as
                  decomposition exceeds photosynthesis—a short-term
                  effect (years to decades) that may be important over
                  the next century if fire frequency increases. Over
                  the long term (many centuries), net carbon storage
                  through a fire cycle is zero if stands replace
                  themselves.  Therefore, equilibrium response of
                  landscape carbon storage to changes in fire
                  frequency will depend on how stand age distribution
                  changes, on the carbon storage of different stand
                  ages, and on postfire regeneration.  In a case study
                  of Yellowstone National Park, equilibrium values of
                  landscape carbon storage were resistant to large
                  changes in fire frequency because these forests
                  regenerate quickly, the current fire interval is
                  very long, the most rapid changes in carbon storage
                  occur in the first century, and carbon storage is
                  similar for stands of different ages. The conversion
                  of forest to meadow or to sparser forest can have a
                  large impact on landscape carbon storage, and this
                  process is likely to be important for many conifer
                  forests.}

                  ethanol plant is determined by the trade-off between
                  increasing transportation costs for feedstocks
                  versus decreasing average plant costs as the plant
                  size increases. The ethanol plant is modeled under
                  the assumption that it utilizes recent technological
                  advancements in dilute acid hydrolysis. Potential
                  feedstocks include energy crops, crop residues and
                  woody biomass. It is found that the recent
                  technological advancements appear to make ethanol
                  competitive with gasoline, but only if higher valued
                  chemicals are produced as co-products with the
                  ethanol. The low cost and chemical composition of
                  crop residues make them attractive as a feedstock.},

                  and greater spatial continuity of organic material
                  on the ground in many forests. This material serves
                  both as potential fuel for forest fires and habitat
                  for a large array of forest species. Managers must
                  balance fuel reduction to reduce wildfire hazard
                  with fuel retention targets to maintain other forest
                  functions. This study reports fuel consumption and
                  changes to coarse woody debris attributes with
                  prescribed burns ignited under different fuel
                  moisture conditions. Replicated early season burn,
                  late season burn, and unburned control plots were
                  established in old-growth mixed conifer forest in
                  Sequoia National Park that had not experienced fire
                  for more than 120 years. Early season burns were
                  ignited during June 2002 when fuels were relatively
                  moist, and late season burns were ignited during
                  September/October 2001 when fuels were dry. Fuel
                  loading and coarse woody debris abundance, cover,
                  volume, and mass were evaluated prior to and after
                  the burns. While both types of burns reduced fuel
                  loading, early season burns consumed significantly
                  less of the total dead and down organic matter than
                  late season burns (67\% versus 88\%). This
                  difference in fuel consumption between burning
                  treatments was significant for most all woody fuel
                  components evaluated, plus the litter and duff
                  layers. Many logs were not entirely consumed -
                  therefore the number of logs was not significantly
                  changed by fire - but burning did reduce log length,
                  cover, volume, and mass. Log cover, volume, and mass
                  were reduced to a lesser extent by early season
                  burns than late season burns, as a result of higher
                  wood moisture levels. Early season burns also spread
                  over less of the ground surface within the burn
                  perimeter (73\%) than late season burns (88\%), and
                  were significantly patchier.  Organic material
                  remaining after a fire can dam sediments and reduce
                  erosion, while unburned patches may help mitigate
                  the impact of fire on fire-sensitive species by
                  creating refugia from which these species can
                  recolonize burned areas. Early season burns may be
                  an effective means of moderating potential ecosystem
                  damage when treating heavy and/or continuous fuels
                  resulting from long periods of fire exclusion, if
                  burning during this season is not detrimental to
                  other forest functions.},

                  &#215; 106 ha of farmland in California. Combining
                  the CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) model
                  with data on harvest indices and yields, we
                  calculated net primary production, woody production
                  in orchard and vineyard crops, and soil carbon. Over
                  the 21-yr period, two trends resulted in carbon
                  sequestration. Yields increased an average of
                  20&#37;, corresponding to greater plant biomass and
                  more carbon returned to the soils. Also, orchards
                  and vineyards increased in area from 0.7 &#215; 106
                  ha to 1.0 &#215; 106 ha, displacing field crops and
                  sequestering woody carbon. Our model estimates that
                  California&#39;s agriculture sequestered an average
                  of 19 g C&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;yr&#8722;1.
                  Sequestration was lowest in non-rice annual
                  cropland, which sequestered 9 g
                  C&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;yr&#8722;1 of soil carbon, and
                  highest on land that switched from annual cropland
                  to perennial cropland.  Land that switched from
                  annual crops to vineyards sequestered 68 g
                  C&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;yr&#8722;1, and land that
                  switched from annual crops to orchards sequestered
                  85 g C&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;yr&#8722;1.  Rice fields,
                  because of a reduction in field burning, sequestered
                  55 g C&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;yr&#8722;1 in the
                  1990s. Over the 21 years, California&#39;s 3.6
                  &#215; 106 ha of agricultural land sequestered 11.0
                  Tg C within soils and 3.5 Tg C in woody biomass, for
                  a total of 14.5 Tg C statewide. This is equal to
                  0.7&#37; of the state&#39;s total fossil fuel
                  emissions over the same time period. If
                  California&#39;s agriculture adopted conservation
                  tillage, changed management of almond and walnut
                  prunings, and used all of its orchard and vineyard
                  waste wood in the biomass power plants in the state,
                  California&#39;s agriculture could offset up to
                  1.6&#37; of the fossil fuel emissions in the state.}

  abstract =	 {[1] Building emission inventories for the fires in
                  boreal regions remains a challenging task with
                  significant uncertainties in the methods used. In
                  this work, we assess the impact of seasonal trends
                  in fuel consumption and flaming/smoldering ratios on
                  emissions of species dominated by flaming combustion
                  (e. g., NOx) and species dominated by smoldering
                  combustion ( e. g., CO). This is accomplished using
                  measurements of CO and NOy at the free tropospheric
                  Pico Mountain observatory in the central North
                  Atlantic during the active boreal fire seasons of
                  2004 and 2005. Delta NOy/Delta CO enhancement ratios
                  in aged fire plumes had higher values in June-July
                  (7.3 X 10(-3) mol mol(-1)) relative to the values in
                  August- September (2.8 X 10(-3) mol mol(-1)),
                  indicating that NOx/CO emission ratios declined
                  significantly as the fire season progressed. This is
                  consistent with our understanding that an increased
                  amount of fuel is consumed via smoldering combustion
                  during late summer, as deeper burning of the drying
                  organic soil layer occurs. A major growth in fuel
                  consumption per unit area is also expected, due to
                  deeper burning. Emissions of CO and NOx from North
                  American boreal fires were estimated using the
                  Boreal Wildland Fire Emissions Model, and their
                  long-range transport to the sampling site was
                  modeled using FLEXPART. These simulations were
                  generally consistent with the observations, but the
                  modeled seasonal decline in the Delta NOy/Delta CO
                  enhancement ratio was less than observed.
                  Comparisons using alternative fire emission
                  injection height scenarios suggest that plumes with
                  the highest CO levels at the observatory were lofted
                  well above the boundary layer, likely as a result of
                  intense crown fires.},

                  simulate the response of vegetation distribution,
                  carbon, and fire to the historical climate and to
                  two contrasting scenarios of climate change in
                  California.  The results of the simulations for the
                  historical climate compared favorably to independent
                  estimates and observations, but validation of the
                  results was complicated by the lack of land use
                  effects in the model. The response to increasing
                  temperatures under both scenarios was characterized
                  by a shift in dominance from needle-leaved to
                  broad-leaved life-forms and by increases in
                  vegetation productivity, especially in the
                  relatively cool and mesic regions of the state. The
                  simulated response to changes in precipitation were
                  complex, involving not only the effect of changes in
                  soil moisture on vegetation productivity, but also
                  changes in tree&#8211;grass competition mediated by
                  fire.  Summer months were warmer and persistently
                  dry under both scenarios, so the trends in simulated
                  fire area under both scenarios were primarily a
                  response to changes in vegetation biomass. Total
                  ecosystem carbon increased under both climate
                  scenarios, but the proportions allocated to the wood
                  and grass carbon pools differed. The results of the
                  simulations underscore the potentially large impact
                  of climate change on California ecosystems, and the
                  need for further use and development of dynamic
                  vegetation models using various ensembles of climate
                  change scenarios.}

                  controls on the area burned by. re in different
                  vegetation types in the western United States. We
                  demonstrate that wild. re area burned (WFAB) in the
                  American West was controlled by climate during the
                  20th century (1916-2003).  Persistent
                  ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and
                  WFAB are grouped by vegetation type
                  (ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces
                  exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low
                  precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index
                  (PDSI), and high temperature. Grass-and
                  shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive
                  relationships with antecedent precipitation or
                  PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain
                  33-87\% (mean = 64\%) of WFAB, indicating strong
                  linkages between climate and area burned. For
                  1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate
                  explained 25-57\% (mean = 39\%) of the
                  variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to
                  the mean squared for different data sets at
                  different spatial scales. The importance of
                  antecedent climate (summer drought in forested
                  ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in
                  shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the
                  mechanism behind the observed. re-climate
                  relationships is climatic preconditioning of large
                  areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing
                  fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of
                  climate change on. re regimes will therefore vary
                  with the relative energy or water limitations of
                  ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise
                  between ecologically imprecise state-level and
                  localized gridded fire data. The differences in
                  climate . re relationships among the ecoprovinces
                  underscore the need to consider ecological context
                  (vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to
                  identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite
                  the possible influence of. re suppression,
                  exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still
                  substantially controlled by climate. The
                  implications for planning and management are that
                  future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will
                  likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal
                  variation in climate. In fuel-limited ecosystems,

                  for its dearth of remnant native grass populations
                  and for low native grass seedling establishment
                  within grasslands now dominated by non-native annual
                  species. In contrast, remnant populations are common
                  along the coast, and studies have shown an ability
                  for seedlings and adults to compete with non-native
                  annual grasses. The invasibility of well-established
                  populations of native grasses in the Central Valley
                  remains unclear.  The objectives of this study were
                  to compare the invasibility of native grasses
                  differing in density and species composition and,
                  given the species in this study, to assess the
                  ability of mixes with greater species richness to
                  resist invasion relative to their abilities in
                  monoculture. In the Sacramento Valley of California,
                  six species of native grasses were planted at three
                  densities in monospecific and mixed-species
                  plots. Percent cover of native perennial and
                  non-native annual grasses was measured in years 2
                  and 3, and biomass was sampled in year 5. Native
                  grass biomass and, to a lesser extent, species
                  composition were important in explaining variation
                  in non-native grass invasibility in the fifth
                  year. Species-rich treatments did not experience
                  less invasion than would be expected by the
                  proportional invasibility of each species in
                  monoculture. However, invasibility of plots
                  consisting of slower growing, shorter statured
                  species decreased over time, suggesting a
                  successional benefit to diverse communities.  This
                  study demonstrates that established stands of native
                  grasses in the Sacramento Valley can resist invasion
                  by non-native annual grasses and that stand biomass
                  is a particularly important factor in determining
                  invasibility.}

  abstract =	 {Continental-scale studies of western North America
                  have attributed recent increases in annual area
                  burned and fire size to a warming climate, but these
                  studies have focussed on large fires and have left
                  the issues of fire severity and ignition frequency
                  unaddressed.  Lightning ignitions, any of which
                  could burn a large area given appropriate conditions
                  for fire spread, could be the first indication of
                  more frequent fire. We examined the relationship
                  between snowpack and the ignition and size of fires
                  that occurred in Yosemite National Park, California
                  (area 3027 km(2)), between 1984 and 2005. During
                  this period, 1870 fires burned 77 718 ha. Decreased
                  spring snowpack exponentially increased the number
                  of lightning-ignited fires. Snowpack mediated
                  lightning-ignited fires by decreasing the proportion
                  of lightning strikes that caused lightning-ignited
                  fires and through fewer lightning strikes in years
                  with deep snowpack. We also quantified fire severity
                  for the 103 fires > 40 ha with satellite
                  fire-severity indices using 23 years of Landsat
                  Thematic Mapper data. The proportion of the
                  landscape that burned at higher severities and the
                  complexity of higher-severity burn patches increased
                  with the log(10) of annual area burned. Using one
                  snowpack forecast, we project that the number of
                  lightning-ignited fires will increase 19.1\% by 2020
                  to 2049 and the annual area burned at high severity
                  will increase 21.9\%. Climate-induced decreases in
                  snowpack and the concomitant increase in fire
                  severity suggest that existing assumptions may be
                  understated fires may become more frequent and more

                  degraded lands to sequester C or of using
                  sustainable forest harvests to displace fossil
                  fuels.  Storing C on-site in forests and harvesting
                  forests for a sustainable flow of forest products
                  are not necessarily conflicting options if we
                  recognize that their relative merits in mitigating
                  net emissions of C will depend on site-specific
                  factors, such as forest productivity and the
                  efficiency with which harvested material is
                  used. Since the land available for reforestation or
                  development of forest plantations is limited, the
                  relative merits of the different mitigation
                  strategies need to be considered. We use a
                  mathematical model of C stocks and flows to compare
                  the net effect on C emissions to the atmosphere for
                  the two approaches over a range of values of forest
                  productivity and the efficiency of product use. When
                  sustainably-produced forest products are used
                  inefficiently to displace fossil fuels, the greater
                  C benefit is achieved through reforestation and
                  protection of standing forests, and increasing the
                  rate of stand growth yields little gain.  However,
                  when forest products are used efficiently to
                  displace fossil fuels, sustainable harvest produces
                  the greater net C benefits, and the benefit
                  increases rapidly with increasing productivity.},

                  data on charcoal in lake sediments and
                  reconstructions from fire-scarred trees. Although
                  current fire management focuses on fuel reductions
                  to bring fuel loadings back to their historical
                  ranges, at the regional scale extreme fire weather
                  is still the dominant influence on area burned and
                  fire severity. Current forecasting tools are limited
                  to short-term predictions of fire weather, but
                  increased understanding of large-scale oceanic and
                  atmospheric patterns in the Pacific Ocean (e.g., El
                  Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal
                  Oscillation) may improve our ability to predict
                  climatic variability at seasonal to annual
                  leads. Associations between these quasi-periodic
                  patterns and fire occurrence, though evident in some
                  regions, have been difficult to establish in
                  others. Increased temperature in the future will
                  likely extend fire seasons throughout the western
                  United States, with more fires occurring earlier and
                  later than is currently typical, and will increase
                  the total area burned in some regions.  If climatic
                  change increases the amplitude and duration of
                  extreme fire weather, we can expect significant
                  changes in the distribution and abundance of
                  dominant plant species in some ecosystems, which
                  would thus affect habitat of some sensitive plant
                  and animal species.  Some species that are sensitive
                  to fire may decline, whereas the distribution and
                  abundance of species favored by fire may be
                  enhanced.  The effects of climatic change will
                  partially depend on the extent to which resource
                  management modifies vegetation structure and fuels.

                  ocurrencia de incendios, aunque evidente en algunas
                  regiones, ha sido dificil de establecer en otras. El
                  futuro incremento de temperatura probablemente
                  extendera las temporadas de incendios en el oeste de
                  Estados Unidos, con mas incendios antes y despues de
                  lo tipico actualmente, e incremento en la superficie
                  quemada en algunas regiones. Si el cambio climatico
                  incrementa la amplitud y duracion de clima igneo
                  extremo, podemos esperar cambios significativos en
                  la distribucion y abundancia de especies de plantas
                  dominantes en algunos ecosistemas, lo cual afectaria
                  el habitat de algunas especies de animales y plantas
                  sensibles. Algunas especies sensibles al fuego
                  pueden declinar, mientras que puede aumentar la
                  distribucion y abundancia de especies favorecidas
                  por el fuego.  Los efectos del cambio climatico
                  dependeran parcialmente de la medida en que la
                  gestion de recursos modifique la estructura de la
                  vegetacion y los combustibles.}

                  to fire, yet long-term effects of fire on soil,
                  water and nutrients remain largely unknown.  To
                  determine whether frequent burning increases the
                  tendency of soils to crust and alters soil
                  chemistry, topsoils from 19 sites were examined in
                  Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape where
                  annual burning and fire exclusion experiments had
                  been conducted for at least 28 years. A comparison
                  of soils from burnt and unburnt plots revealed that
                  composite samples taken to a depth of 10 cm from
                  burnt plots had lower laboratory infiltration,
                  electrical conductivity (EC) of 1:5 extracts,
                  water-soluble K, water-soluble NH4, total C, total N
                  and labile C. Burnt plots had higher pH in KCl,
                  water dispersible clay and modulus of rupture. Rate
                  of soil respiration from composite samples (0-2 cm)
                  from burnt plots was lower than from unburnt plots
                  (means of 21 vs. 36 ng C g-1 s-1). Rainfall
                  simulation on the same samples demonstrated that
                  burnt plots crusted more rapidly than unburnt plots
                  (19 vs. 35 mm h-1), while results from sampling at
                  1-cm intervals revealed that the greatest
                  differences between burnt and unburnt plots were in
                  the 0-1 cm layer. The top few centimetres of soil
                  are likely to have a disproportionate effect on
                  ecosystem functioning by influencing the rate of
                  infiltration and mineralisation of soil organic
                  matter. This thin surface layer has been named the
                  pedoderm in this paper. Soil from 0-1 cm in burnt
                  plots had lower total C (means of 0.8\% vs. 2.7\%
                  for burnt and unburnt plots, respectively), total N
                  (0.07\% vs. 0.23\%), (NH4)OAc-extractable Ca (7
                  vs. 17 mmolc kg-1), Mg (2 vs. 7 mmolc kg-1), K (0.8
                  vs. 1.5 mmolc kg-1) and a greater exchangeable Na
                  percentage (17\% vs. 8\%). The results indicate that
                  burning increases soil crusting. This was ascribed
                  to a decrease in humus content (and associated
                  disaggregating effect) and an increase in the
                  dispersion of clay. Nutrients are lost from burnt
                  plots over time, probably by the removal of ash in
                  surface runoff. Calcium, Mg, and K were lost more
                  readily than Na probably because plants take up
                  these nutrients in greater concentration than
                  Na. The net effect was an increase in the
                  exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP).  Crusting on
                  burnt plots may be self-perpetuating, because
                  increased runoff is likely to increase the loss of
                  soluble salts.},

  journal =	 {Forest Ecology and Management},

  abstract =	 {More than a century of fire exclusion and past
                  timber management practices in many Sierra Nevada
                  mixed-conifer forests have led to increased stand
                  densities and fuel accumulation, with a
                  corresponding risk of large, high severity
                  wildfires. To reduce hazardous fuel accumulations
                  and restore the health and natural processes of
                  forest ecosystems, fuel management programs often
                  employ thinning and prescribed fire treatments, both
                  alone and in combination. We evaluated forest floor
                  and mineral soil chemical and physical
                  characteristics following these treatments in a
                  managed Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest using a
                  fully replicated study design with four separate
                  treatments: THIN, BURN, THIN + BURN, and an
                  untreated CONTROL. Compared to the CONTROL, the BURN
                  and THIN + BURN treatments consumed a large amount
                  of the forest floor, reducing the mass and depth by
                  more than 80\%.  These treatments reduced the forest
                  floor C and N pools by more than 85\%, resulting in
                  reductions of 25 Mg C ha-1 and more than 700 kg N
                  ha-1 from the forest floor. Despite these large
                  losses from the organic horizons, no significant
                  differences in mineral soil total C and N pools were
                  detected among treatments. Compared with the CONTROL
                  and THIN treatments, the BURN and THIN + BURN
                  significantly increased the mineral soil NO3-N
                  concentration, pool of inorganic N, pH, and exposed
                  bare soil. The THIN + BURN treatment significantly
                  increased the concentrations of NH4-N and
                  exchangeable Ca relative to the CONTROL.  No
                  significant differences in the net rates of
                  nitrification, N mineralization, or bulk density
                  were detected among the four treatments. The BURN
                  treatment reduced mineral soil C concentration and
                  CEC, while the THIN + BURN treatment had the
                  greatest increase in inorganic N. Fire effects on
                  soil pH and inorganic N were moderated in skid
                  trails due to reduced fuel continuity and
                  consumption. In light of the current management
                  emphasis on hazardous fuels reduction, we recommend
                  that researchers investigating fire effects in
                  harvested stands include skid trail influences in
                  their study design.},

                  present a new approach deriving the structure of the
                  upper canopy by segmenting single trees from small
                  footprint LIDAR data and deducing their geometric
                  properties. The accuracy of the LIDAR data is
                  evaluated using six geometric reference targets,
                  with the standard deviation of the LIDAR returns on
                  the targets being as low as 0.06 m. The segmentation
                  is carried out by using cluster analysis on the
                  LIDAR raw data in all three coordinate
                  dimensions. From the segmented clusters, tree
                  position, tree height, and crown diameter are
                  derived and compared with field measurements.  A
                  robust linear regression of 917 tree height
                  measurements yields a slope of 0.96 with an offset
                  of 1 m and the adjusted R2 resulting at
                  0.92. However, crown diameter is not well matched by
                  the field measurements, with R2 being as low as 0.2,
                  which is most certainly due to random errors in the
                  field measurements. Finally, a geometric
                  reconstruction of the forest scene using a
                  paraboloid model is carried out using values of tree
                  position, tree height, crown diameter, and crown

                  collected, stored, and hauled for about
                  \$43.10-51.60/dry ton using conventional baling
                  equipment for conversion facilities ranging from 500
                  to 4000 dry tons/day. The cost difference between
                  facility sizes is due to
                  transportation. Transportation, collection and
                  baling, and farmer payments account for over 90\% of
                  total delivered costs. These estimates are based on
                  average corn stover resource availability
                  assumptions and are inclusive of all costs including
                  farmer payments. Under conditions of high resource
                  availability costs can be lowered by \$6-10/dry
                  ton. Delivered costs increase considerably under low
                  resource availability conditions.}

                  sequestering it in growing trees. The net flux of C
                  to the atmosphere can also be reduced if trees are
                  burned to displace the burning of fossil fuels and
                  are then replanted to recycle the C back into the
                  biosphere, or if wood is used for products that
                  store carbon and are otherwise made from other, more
                  energy-intensive materials. A computer model is
                  employed to calculate carbon balances of two land
                  management and biomass utilization scenarios -
                  conventional forest management and short-rotation
                  forestry. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the most
                  important site and system dependent parameters for
                  the net reduction of carbon emissions are the site
                  occupancy prior to the project, growth rate,

                  non-energy products, and carbon emission rates and
                  efficiencies of displaced fossil fuel cycles. The
                  results demonstrate that time is another important
                  consideration and that projects can look
                  considerably different, in terms of C balance, when
                  the endpoint of the analysis is 20, 50, or 100

                  species. We test this hypothesis and explore its
                  implications for the restoration of native
                  ecosystems in one of the most dramatic ecological
                  invasions worldwide, the replacement of native
                  perennial grasses by exotic annual grasses and forbs
                  in 9.2 million hectares of California
                  grasslands. The long-term persistence of these
                  exotic annuals has been thought to imply that the
                  exotics are superior competitors.  However,
                  seed-addition experiments in a southern California
                  grassland revealed that native perennial species,
                  which had lower requirements for deep soil water,
                  soil nitrate, and light, were strong competitors,
                  and they markedly depressed the abundance and
                  fecundity of exotic annuals after overcoming
                  recruitment limitations. Native species reinvaded
                  exotic grasslands across experimentally imposed
                  nitrogen, water, and disturbance gradients. Thus,
                  exotic annuals are not superior competitors but
                  rather may dominate because of prior disturbance and
                  the low dispersal abilities and extreme current
                  rarity of native perennials. If our results prove to
                  be general, it may be feasible to restore native
                  California grassland flora to at least parts of its
                  former range.}

                  worldwide respond to higher prices and convert
                  forest and grassland to new cropland to replace the

                  from land-use change, we found that corn-based
                  ethanol, instead of producing a 20\% savings, nearly
                  doubles greenhouse emissions over 30 years and
                  increases greenhouse gases for 167 years. Biofuels
                  from switchgrass, if grown on U.S.  corn lands,
                  increase emissions by 50\%. This result raises

                  assessment ) are well adapted to evaluate
                  environmental impacts from a global perspective. For
                  impact categories that are not global in nature such

                  and sustainability of the transport and energy
                  sectors of the economy. A life cycle assessment
                  model was developed to examine environmental
                  implications of the production and use of ethanol in
                  automobiles in Ontario, Canada. The results were
                  compared to those of low-sulfur reformulated
                  gasoline (RFG) in a functionally equivalent
                  automobile. Two time frames were evaluated, one
                  near-term (2010), which examines converting a
                  dedicated energy crop (switchgrass) and an
                  agricultural residue (corn stover) to ethanol; and
                  one mid-term (2020), which assumes technological
                  improvements in the switchgrass-derived ethanol life
                  cycle. Near-term results show that, compared to a
                  RFG automobile, life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG)
                  emissions are 57\% lower for an E85-fueled
                  automobile derived from switchgrass and 65\% lower
                  for ethanol from corn stover, on a grams of CO2
                  equivalent per kilometer basis. Corn stover ethanol
                  exhibits slightly lower life cycle GHG emissions,
                  primarily due to sharing emissions with grain
                  production.  Through projected improvements in crop
                  and ethanol yields, results for the mid-term
                  scenario show that GHG emissions could be 2535\%
                  lower than those in 2010 and that, even with
                  anticipated improvements in RFG automobiles, E85
                  automobiles could still achieve up to 70\% lower GHG
                  emissions across the life cycle.}

                  conditions. Fuels Management Analyst was used to
                  model fire behavior and tree mortality. Thinning and
                  mastication each reduced crown bulk density by
                  approximately 19\% in mechanical only and mechanical
                  plus fire treatments. Prescribed burning
                  significantly reduced the total combined fuel load
                  of litter, duff, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 h fuels by as

                  and fire only treatments in terms of fireline

                  treatments resulted in the lowest average fireline
                  intensities, rate of spread, and predicted

                  most severe modeled fire behavior and tree
                  mortality. Mechanical only treatments were an
                  improvement over controls but still resulted in tree

                  areas were selected by fire managers from the Bureau

                  to communities and the need for range and wildlife
                  improvement. Afire density grid was derived from the
                  BLM's fire start layer to identify historically high
                  ignition areas. FireFamily Plus was used to
                  summarize and analyze historical weather and
                  calculate seasonal severity and percentile
                  reports. Information from FireFamily was used in
                  FARSITE and FlamMap to model pre- and post-treatment

                  increase the accumulation rate of soil organic C
                  (SOC), thereby sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere.
                  This study was conducted to quantify potential soil
                  C sequestration rates for different crops in
                  response to decreasing tillage intensity or
                  enhancing rotation complexity, and to estimate the
                  duration of time over which sequestration may
                  occur. Analyses of C sequestration rates were
                  completed using a global database of 67 long-term
                  agricultural experiments, consisting of 276 paired
                  treatments. Results indicate, on average, that a
                  change from conventional tillage (CT) to no-till
                  (NT) can sequester 57 {+/-} 14 g C m-2 yr-1,
                  excluding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow
                  systems which may not result in SOC accumulation
                  with a change from CT to NT. Enhancing rotation
                  complexity can sequester an average 20 {+/-} 12 g C
                  m-2 yr-1, excluding a change from continuous corn
                  (Zea mays L.) to corn-soybean (Glycine max L.) which
                  may not result in a significant accumulation of
                  SOC. Carbon sequestration rates, with a change from
                  CT to NT, can be expected to peak in 5 to 10 yr with
                  SOC reaching a new equilibrium in 15 to 20
                  yr. Following initiation of an enhancement in
                  rotation complexity, SOC may reach a new equilibrium
                  in approximately 40 to 60 yr. Carbon sequestration
                  rates, estimated for a number of individual crops
                  and crop rotations in this study, can be used in
                  spatial modeling analyses to more accurately predict
                  regional, national, and global C sequestration
                  potentials.}

                  changes in wildfire has been systematically

                  discussion of changes in western United States
                  wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th-
                  and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a
                  comprehensive database of large wildfires in western
                  United States forests since 1970 and compared it
                  with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we
                  show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly
                  and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher
                  large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations,

                  where land-use histories have relatively little

  abstract =	 { Sawmill residue is an important component of
                  biomass resources for California; however, factors
                  allowing for projections of future resources are not
                  well established. Differences exist relative to
                  timber diameter class, species type, and milling
                  technology used in other western states for which
                  residue factors have been developed. In this study,
                  sawmill residue production was estimated by two
                  methods. The first utilized lumber production and a
                  sawmill residue volume factor, while the second used
                  total log consumption by sawmills and a sawmill
                  residue weight factor. These two factors were
                  developed based on literature, historic data, and
                  experiences from timber specialists, which can be
                  used to predict sawmill residue production in recent
                  years in California. Estimated sawmill residue
                  generation in California ranged from 2.2 to 2.6 Mt,
                  dry weight basis, in 2002 and 2.2-2.5 Mt in 2003.
                  Residues were also estimated for 1988, 1994, and
                  2000 for comparison to other reported estimates for
                  sawmill residues in these years.  Coarse and fine
                  residues and bark accounted for approximately 45\%,
                  32\%, and 23\% of total sawmill residues
                  generated. Potentially, more than two million metric
                  tons of sawmill residues are available for bioenergy
                  production and could contribute to California's
                  Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) for increasing
                  amounts of electricity from renewable resources and
                  to other policy objectives for increasing amounts of
                  renewable biofuels and bio-based products.},

                  designed to incentivize a diverse array of available
                  strategies for reducing transportation greenhouse
                  gas (GHG) emissions. It provides strong incentives
                  for fuels with lower GHG emissions, while explicitly
                  requiring a 10\% reduction in California’s
                  transportation fuel GHG intensity by 2020.  This
                  paper investigates the potential for cost-effective
                  GHG reductions from electrification and expanded use
                  of biofuels. The analysis indicates that fuel
                  providers could meet the standard using a portfolio
                  approach that employs both biofuels and electricity,
                  which would reduce the risks and uncertainties
                  associated with the progress of cellulosic and
                  battery technologies, feedstock prices, land
                  availability, and the sustainability of the various
                  compliance approaches. Our analysis is based on the
                  details of California’s development of an LCFS;
                  however, this research approach could be
                  generalizable to a national U.S.  standard and to
                  similar programs in Europe and Canada.}

  abstract =	 {Ethanol is produced from organic material and is
                  important as a strategic and cleaner alternative to
                  fossil fuels. The cost of producing ethanol, which
                  ultimately affects its price and demand, depends to
                  a large extent on the delivered cost of raw
                  materials. For a planned ethanol production
                  facility, the cost of raw material is a function of
                  (1) the facility location, (2) the facility size,
                  and (3) the method of procurement. In a previous
                  paper, two of the authors provided a methodology for
                  computing a marginal price "surface" to better
                  understand the location decision under several
                  facility size scenarios.  The methodology was
                  implemented in a GIS-based decision support system
                  to investigate the economic feasibility of locating
                  a switchgrass-to-ethanol conversion facility in
                  Alabama. In this paper, we use the methodology to
                  construct delivered cost surfaces in order to
                  evaluate two methods of procurement pricing; fixed
                  and discriminatory. In the fixed pricing method of
                  procurement, the facility pays one fixed price per
                  delivered tonne. In the discriminatory pricing
                  method of procurement, the facility pays a
                  source-specific price per tonne before delivery and
                  then pays the cost of delivery transportation. The
                  results from the current study confirm the cost
                  advantage of discriminatory over fixed pricing.
                  However, it was observed that the relative cost
                  advantage showed considerable variation as a
                  function of location and facility size.},
