scenario,BE,"Pulpwood from main stem of nonsawtimber trees from additional thin from below harvesting operations + Pulpwood from main stem of nonsawtimber trees from current harvesting operations (shift in demand from current users (pulp panels) to bioenergy users) + Tops, branches and small trees."
scenario,B2,"Cumulative supply for tops/ branches and chip trees (no limitation to stop when sawlog harvest consumption is met).  West has chip trees <7in.dbh, north and south have chip trees <5 in dbh. Supply in each state is limited so treatments will not supply more than the current level of sawlog harvest. Stumpage prices are added for biomass taken from non-federal land."
scenario,R70_T30,Integrated operations with 70% residues and 30% thinnings.
